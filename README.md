Anna Raman – Quarantined Community
Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute
This is my website on *quarantine/isolation* which I have created with the aim of providing some support and resources for all members of the public currently enduring the lockdown. 

The website presents 3 areas of focus; the mind, body, what we can do to help. There is a message-board page which hopes to invite users to discuss their personal experiences/recommendations. There is a frequently asked questions page which covers the most asked questions that members of the public have regarding the coronavirus and the quarantine. Finally, there is a contact page containing a contact form.

UX
My focus with the design was to facilitate the users search for what they are looking for; hence, the simplistic layout of the website. I chose a neutral colour scheme to maintain *”I know this is important and not a joke” whilst making scrolling through the website as aesthetically pleasing to as many people as possible.

Why I chose the layout – how this optimises users speed of feeling satisfied (finding what they are looking for)
For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose. In the 'Work/Travail' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access.
