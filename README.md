# Anna Raman – Quarantined Community
Milestone Project 1: User-Centric Frontend Development – Code Institute
This is my website on quarantining, which I have created with the aim of providing some support and resources for all members of the public currently enduring the lockdown. 

The website presents 3 areas of focus; the mind, body, what we can do to help. There is a message-board page which hopes to invite users to discuss their personal experiences/recommendations. 
There is a frequently asked questions page which covers the most asked questions that members of the public have regarding the coronavirus and the quarantine. Finally, there is a contact page containing a contact form.


 
### UX
My focus with the design was to facilitate the users search for what they are looking for; hence, the simplistic and minimalist layout of the website. 
I chose a neutral colour scheme to maintain the acknowledgement of the serious nature of the lockdown, whilst making scrolling through the website as aesthetically pleasing to as many people as possible.

### Features

* The first section of the home page provides links to each section of the page, to direct the user to exactly what they are looking for. 
* The bootstrap breadcrumbs feature eases navigation by showing the user at which page they are currently located.
* The messageboard page provides a (currently static) feature which alows the user to find the answer to their exact question, had the answer not been provided on the website.
* The accordion on the FAQ page allows the user to find an answer to their question by simple on-click dropdown, whilst hiding the rest of the information that may not be of interest to them.
* The contact page provides a form for the user to fill it if they wish to get in contact. It also provides quick links to some useful websites that the user may want to seek more information from. 


#### Features Left to Implement

Going forward, I would like to add JavaScript to many aspects of my website, once I have developed the skill to do so. 
For example, I would like to make the message board interactive to encourage user-interaction.
I would also use JavaScript to implement a point-scoring function on the comments, whereby users have the ability to upvote or downvote a comment so that the most relevant comments appear first in the stream.
Finally, I would add a ‘lockdown update’ page where there would be a live stream of updates regarding the lockdown, corona cases, and recommended courses of action.
